E-Voting system and
voter's signature validation (vsv) pen

Increasing voting integrity with Artificial intelligence (AI)powered pen .

Cralification of terms

Artificial intelligence: this term is used to describe both hardware and software systems that can learn to do basic human Calibration.
AI pen : this term is used to describe a digital  pen stationery that  has artificial intelligence capabilities   which includes signature validation.      
                The Artificial intelligence pen will boost school  productivity . computers have learned to comprehend human perception of logic. its now a  reality that   computers might exceed human intellectual capacity . hence our generation should speed up the learning curve by use of Artificial intelligence aided learning.  Currently our educational system needs technological assist. 



Hence my  question is this  . can we summarize the core functions of a poling station into one pen ? 

short answer is mybe.
Long answer is yes Through the use of Artificial intelligence



 Introducing the Artificial intelligence pen tutor. This Ai stationery will be the  link between offline and  online voting . 
       
            Firstly the Ai pen is   a stationery  gadget that monitors the voters handwriting routines. This pen has the capacity to learn and interact with the voters through the following features

1.signature lock.
2.Accuracy and handwriting coaching.
3.spelling correction .
4.speech correction . 
5.text scanning to speech.
6.basic math calculations
7.group work 



Signature lock 
          This feature allows the voter to lock the pen by use of signature . The pen is designed to automatically lock if it is idle the voters can only unlock it with the signature  that was recorded at school admission.
Hence making the pen  secure.

Accuracy and Handwriting couching
           This feature allows the voters to better his or her handwriting. This feature is made possible due to the help of motion tracking and calibration. The pen can sense when the words cross the guide lines on the book .
Spelling check and correction
            This feature allows the writer to better his or her spelling. The pen analyses hand motion and maps it to a pretrained model. If the words donâ€™t match the pen sends an error warning by showing a red light. Showing the spelling is incorrect. It further  used the ai pen assistance vocals the spell out the correct word through the speaker.
Speech correction.
             This feature allows the student to train. On pronunciation by the use of the pretrained vocals that can translate words and properly pronounce and define English terms.
By use of a database full of vocal lessons ranging from English and Kiswahili etc.
Text to speech .
             This feature allows the student to write words as the  pen dictates This feature is highly customizable .
Math guide
              This feature allows the user to write numerical equations and the pen calculates the answer. This is made possible by the inbuilt calculator  numerical character a recognition and analysis this feature will be updated with  future advancements.
 Group work 
             This feature allows the voters to interact with other voters of a different school .due to network ports the pen can connect with other pens within the school and outside . students can use the pen  solve math quiz that are recorded within the pen and win prizes because we have a way to spot the brilliant minds . This pen helps as examine people. Properly.
Art lessons and games 
             This feature allows the student to learn how to draw with signal guides and picture and pattern tracing. play games like games like spelling bee
And further art works done with pen can be sold in the metaverse as nft .
